    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Kamohelo Khokho. Kamo for short. 
        I'm 22 years old and I'm from South Africa. 
        I went to an all boys school in Bloemfontein called Grey College. 
        I'm currently in North West University studying Human Movement Sciences and Sports Coaching. 
        I'm sure you're wondering why am I programming then if I'm already studying something that's
        so far away from computer science. The simple answer is I found it late. I honestly didn't think 
        it was something I could do. To be honest I still have moments like that, however I'm honestly having
        the best time with it. Pushing myself, learning a skill as difficult as coding. It's not an easy feat.
        Maybe that's why I've become so obsessed with it. It's such an amazing feeling when you solve
        a problem. Although the arrival of the problem makes me want to bang my head against the wall.
        I still have an obsession with improving my skills as a programmer.</p>
    <h3>My favourite hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Weightlifting. I love bodybuilding it teaches me discipline. It helps in keeping focused. It overall just keeps my mind and my body healthy.</li>
            <li>I love video games. Outside of bodybuilding it's my favourite thing in the world. The creativity, time and effort that comes with creating video games will always be impressive to me. I love it.</li>
            <li>I love programming (obviously lol) I've become so obsessed with learning and improving my coding skills. Seeing your creation come to life is honestly the best feeling.</li>
            <li>I really love watching pro-wrestling. Although I must admit that that is a guilty pleasure</li>
            <li>Finally I love watching anime.</li>
    <p>So that's a little about me in a nutshell!</p>
        </ul>
